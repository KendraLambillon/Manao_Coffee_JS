# Manao Coffee with JS

As a final exercise, I created this web site, which I got inspired by the futur bussines of my friend.
The information is not real for the moment but it will be in the future.
For the realization of this mockup I used: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Ajax and the plugins or libraries I needed.

The website is composed of:
* A home page, which is called: index.html
  This is the home page of the web, which contains 4 sections, one of them being where news is loaded from an external file (JSON file).

* A gallery page, called: galeria.html
  This page incorporate a dynamic gallery using JavaScript and jQuery library.

* A budget page, called: presupuesto.html
  This page contain a form that is divided into two parts:
  1. Contact information: in this first part of the form the user's contact information is requested. The contact data is validated using JavaScript, in order to meet the criteria.
  1. Budget: in this second part of the form, the user is asked to choose from several options to calculate a quote.

* A contact page, called: contacto.html
  In this page, I insert a dynamic map, which marks the location of the business and calculate the route to the customer's location. To do this I used an API such as OpenStreetMaps, as well as several JavaScript libraries.
  In addition to the map, I specified the contact details and location of the company.
